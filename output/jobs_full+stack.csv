Who We're Looking For

Revenue.io is looking for a Full Stack Software Engineer who's not here to play it safe—they're here to become world-class.

You might not have a decade of experience yet—but you work like someone who will catch and pass those who do. You have a solid academic or technical foundation, an obsessive drive to grow, and an unwavering belief that generative AI will reshape software engineering—and you're here to lead that wave.

This role is for someone who wants to build, learn, and iterate faster than anyone around them, and set a new standard for how modern engineering teams should work. We're looking for a generative-native full-stack developer—someone who uses tools like Copilot, Cursor, Devin, and Claude as default collaborators, and is hungry to prove that talent, tools, and work ethic beat experience every time.

If you're looking to accelerate your growth by an order of magnitude, this is your launchpad.

What You'll Do
Deliver full-stack features across Java/Spring Boot (backend) and React/TypeScript (frontend), using generative AI tools as your default starting point—whether you're scaffolding components, building services, or reviewing code, AI is a core part of your workflow.
Use generative tools by default—for scaffolding services and components, writing tests, debugging, building mocks/stubs, writing documentation, and even planning.
Lean into tools like Copilot, Devin, and Cursor to increase your throughput and sharpen your technical thinking—generative AI is your co-engineer.
Apply generative tooling to automate unit/integration test generation, generate validation logic, document APIs and components, and explore edge cases early.
Own features from design to deployment—partnering with more senior engineers to iterate quickly and deliver with confidence.
Explore and test new tooling, plugins, and workflows to continuously raise the bar on what fast, high-quality engineering looks like.
Participate in team rituals—standups, design sessions, code reviews, retros—and bring your perspective, questions, and learnings.
Share feedback on what tools and techniques work best, and help the entire team evolve with you.
What You Bring
1–3 years of full-stack experience, or equivalent through internships, academic work, or open-source contributions.
Strong CS fundamentals and a growth-focused mindset—you understand the ""why"" behind what you build.
Proficiency in Java/Spring Boot (or equivalent backend tech) AND React/TypeScript on the frontend
Demonstrable experience with generative AI tools—you don't just use them, you rely on them and optimize your workflow around them.
Familiarity with AWS services a plus
A proactive mindset, growth obsession, and high personal standards—you want to be the best, and you work like it.
Who You Are
You're generative-native—AI tools aren't a shortcut; they're your default.
You want to be the person that more experienced engineers look to for speed, clarity, and output.
You outlearn everyone around you and help raise the bar for the entire team.
You get better every week—and you're not afraid to show your work.
You want to build things that matter and redefine how modern software development gets done.

Tesla is re-thinking how batteries are made from the ground up. We’re designing new factories, new equipment, new processes, and new software to rapidly scale battery manufacturing, globally. The primary bottleneck to Tesla’s future expansion (and the transition to sustainable transport and energy storage) is our ability to produce and procure batteries – that’s why we’re innovating in-house, with our collection of world-class engineers, to redefine the industry. Software, data, and automation all play a huge part in this strategy.
We’ve built software from scratch with a nimble and high performing team to meet the specific needs of Tesla’s rapid battery manufacturing scale up. This software tracks every component of the cell manufacturing process and acts as the brain of the entire cell factory. It’s key to ensuring batteries are made safely and for understanding how to improve processes. This platform is the conduit for data coming from the line, and it is part of the goal to have more data about manufacturing, end to end, than any other company.
The Cell Software team is responsible for building software solutions that allow the company to redefine manufacturing and production. We focus on implementing effective software advances, distributed fault-tolerant computing, and modern user- experience to manufacturing systems throughout Tesla.

Full Stack Engineer (Enterprise),Roboflow,,"San Francisco, CA",,"$165,000 - $195,000 a year",,"['TensorFlow', 'Power BI', 'Node.js', 'Mid-level', 'Tableau', 'High school diploma or GED', 'AWS', 'Docker', 'Machine learning', 'JavaScript', 'APIs', 'Linux', 'Communication skills', 'Python']","Who We Are
Our mission is to make the world programmable. Sight is one of the key ways we understand the world, and soon this will be true for the software we use, too.
At Roboflow, we’re building the tools, community, and resources needed to make the world programmable with artificial intelligence. Roboflow simplifies building and using computer vision models. Today, over 1M developers, including those from half the Fortune 100, use Roboflow’s machine learning open source and hosted tools. That includes counting cells to accelerate cancer research, improving construction site safety , digitizing floor plans , preserving coral reef populations , guiding drone flight , and much more .
Our team is small relative to our impact, and we believe our user success is our success (not the inverse). A team member summarized: “Roboflow is a company full of giant brains and tiny egos.” We find software has a multiplier effect on all roles (not only product and engineering), so Roboflow employs developers across the company in design, sales, customer support, marketing, and beyond.
We’re supported by great customers and investors, having raised over $63 million from Google Ventures (check out our Series B announcement here !), Y Combinator, Craft Ventures, Sam Altman, Lachy Groom, amongst other leading software investors.
What We're Looking For
Primarily, you like to make great things with passionate colleagues. You are someone that likes to own outcomes, not only inputs. You’re motivated by having responsibility and accountability. You’re eager to ‘do the work,’ big and small.
We’re hiring an enterprise focused engineer to help make Roboflow the best possible platform for enterprise computer vision, and expand partnerships with our enterprise customers. You should have strong communication skills, and a track record of success building computer vision applications and a desire to drive innovation in an enterprise setting.
You’re curious and learning about new technologies, perhaps an early tinkerer with ChatGPT and AI products. You show more than you tell.
You’re motivated by the question, “How can I improve this?” and have a track record of doing so, even in ways adjacent to your role. Much of our current team is made up of former founders and thrive in the level of autonomy at Roboflow. Maybe you had a side hustle in high school or college.
Many Roboflowers have used our tools before joining. One of the best ways to stand out amongst other applicants is to write about something you have built with Roboflow or contribute to one of our open source projects.
What You'll Do
As a member of the Enterprise team, you'll be tasked with creating new features and making improvements anywhere in the Roboflow product. We're looking for technical generalists that aren’t afraid to dive into a new stack or toolchain if the need arises (but JavaScript and Node.js make up the brunt of the existing codebase). You will also help support and make improvements to our enterprise Jetson inference pipeline, so a solid foundation in Linux is highly desirable.
The Enterprise team forms close relationships with Enterprise customers to deeply understand their needs and advance their usage and success with Roboflow. You should expect to frequently be on-site with customers, doing factory tours, and building features needed to make prospective and current customers successful in Computer Vision with Roboflow.
As a member of the Enterprise team, you will also partner closely with the Field Engineering team. Not only to understand and expand partnerships with customers, but to identify opportunities to make the Field Engineers more efficient in collecting visual data and delivering insights to customers based on that data.
Most of the things we work on are parts of the core product (which is an end-to-end pipeline for building computer vision projects spanning from image ingestion to annotation to training and deployment) but from time to time we're also working on things like integrating marketing and sales tools, fighting fires, automating internal processes, and open source projects.
You'll have a wide degree of freedom to advocate for which projects you think should be highest priority and will contribute to increasing engagement and success of enterprise customers. If you need a rigid list of tasks spelled out in a multi-month roadmap, this role probably won't be a good fit.
The majority of our codebase is written in JavaScript, our machine learning and image processing pipeline is in Python. We run primarily on Firebase and GCS, with some machine learning infrastructure on AWS. We're increasingly using Docker (both internally and for customer facing products like our edge inference server). A lot of our code runs in the browser (including some Tensorflow JS) but we're also working on building APIs and client libraries in several languages.
You certainly don't need to be experienced in all of these areas; but should be excited to learn new skill sets as you need them. We also hope you'll bring some new knowledge and experiences you can share to help level-up the rest of the team.
Example Projects
Adding video recording and analysis tools to the Roboflow SaaS application, so that Field Engineers can quickly and efficiently collect and understand customer data.
Streamlining the setup of new devices or inspections in the Roboflow application.
Adding a new workflow block to allow customers to send visual insights to Power BI or Tableau.
Adding new capabilities for edge device management such as GPS coordinate visualization.
 Within one week, you will…
Learn all about computer vision, our product, company, customers, and vision.
Meet with a customer and learn about their use case.
Ship something substantial to an end user
 Within one month, you will…
Onboard in person with your manager (you’ll come to our NY or SF Hub!)
Build your first computer vision project with Roboflow (if you haven't already)
Go on site with an enterprise customer
 Within six months, you will…
Attend your first all company onsite
Be ramped up on other relevant parts of the Roboflow product.
Who You'll Be Working With
Our team of ~50 attracts talent like executives that wanted to return to building, founders with a 100M+ exit, Roboflow users turned team members, open source contributors, a cyclist who biked across the United States, prolific high school hackers, a CTO from 100+ engineering organization, amongst many exceptional others.
You will directly be working with our Enterprise Lead and a team of Full Stack Engineers.
Where You'll Work
Roboflow is distributed across the US and Europe. We currently have Hubs in New York City and San Francisco (and plan to open more as we grow density in new cities). We provide opportunities (like team onsites in different cities) and resources (like a $4000/yr travel stipend) to work in person with other team members as much as you'd like, while also supporting remote team members. You can work from one of our Hubs (we offer a relocation bonus), work from home, work at co-working spaces, etc. We want you to work where you work best!
When You'll Work
Roboflow primarily operates during the daytime hours in the US and there are some synchronous meetings you’ll be expected to attend each week. Apart from that, we have a flexible schedule that allows you to work collaboratively with other team members and asynchronously when needed.
As a member of the Enterprise team, this role requires travel. In addition to two required team meetups, you will travel to be on site with customers 1-2 times per quarter.
What You'll Receive
To determine your salary, we use a number of market and data-driven salary sources. We review all salaries every six months to ensure we stay in line with the market.
 The target compensation for this role is $165,000-$195,000 base, commensurate with experience.
 In addition to our cash compensation, we offer generous perks and benefits. Below are some of the highlights:
$4000/yr Travel Stipend to travel anywhere anytime to work alongside other Roboflowers
$350/mo Productivity stipend to spend on things that make your work environment more productive, like high-speed internet at home or a co-working space
Cover up to 100% of your health insurance costs for you and your partner or family
Equity in the company so we are all invested in the future of computer vision

Earthmover is building a product that solves the biggest storage and compute challenges of our time for users in the deep sciences - think climate, earth observations, biotech, machine learning, and AI.
The Earthmover platform today has two components. Our first product, Arraylake, is a data lake platform for multi-dimensional scientific array data. It enables users to manage and process array data in open standard cloud-native formats, with features like versioning, cataloging, collaboration and access control on top. Our second product, Flux, sits on top of Arraylake and provides an API gateway to multi-dimensional data through standard-compliant APIs. We are also heavy open source contributors in the scientific data space, leading the development of projects such as Zarr, Xarray and our own open source multidimensional array store, Icechunk. We’re actively building powerful features and experiences on top of Icechunk, Arraylake and Flux while also adding more products to our platform to advance the field of scientific computing and accelerate progress in many domains. Some specific problems we’re thinking about:

Collaboration between scientists, teams and organizations. Getting discoverability, sharing, and access controls right.
Transparent, high performance array access, along any dimension.
Groundbreaking open access public datasets to the entire scientific community.
Generating insights for organizations about how they can optimize datasets on our platform.
Navigation, exploration, and visualization of nuanced hierarchical scientific data structures.
Providing highly scalable, highly available, multi-region APIs for data discovery and delivery
JD
As a scientific data platform company, our product has two key objectives: provide a best in class array storage and processing system, and deliver an exceptional collaborative user experience on top of this.

You’re a great fit if you

Are product minded, and excited to work directly with customers & scientists to shape our product to solve their problems.
Have experience designing and building high quality APIs.
Have experience building control layers, user permission systems, or access control tools.
Have experience building highly-available, auto-scaling compute services (e.g. ECS, K8s)
Would enjoy collaborating with other across the whole stack to rapidly iterate on new product features, in particular our web and client libraries. You should be able to understand the whole stack, from low level cloud performance to usability and user experience concerns.
Have at least 6 years experience as a software engineer working on backend systems. Our stack is written in Python, TypeScript, and Rust, experience with any typed backend language is valuable.
Have a genuine enthusiasm for this job description, even if you don’t yet have experience with all of the listed responsibilities. We have a top class team and are open to helping the right candidate grow into these responsibilities over time.

We believe that public sector mission sets matter above anything else. If you feel the same way, we’d love for you to join us.
The Role
You'll be building the next generation of tools that are fundamentally changing how government technology works. We move fast, ship often, and solve complex problems with elegant solutions.
Responsibilities
Shape and own features from start to finish. Your perspective drives how we build, design, and implement solutions that matter.
Work across the full technical spectrum – from crafting robust APIs and type systems to building intuitive frontends and component libraries.
Work with users to understand their workflow and create solutions that transform how they work
Design and build data visualization tools that bring clarity to complex information
Develop innovative AI/ML solutions in a space that has so far been uncharted by modern and cohesive technology solutions
Qualifications
3+ years of full stack experience, building solutions users love
A natural drive to understand users and translate their challenges into elegant solutions
Track record of owning features end-to-end and seeing them through to success
Government, govtech, or defense experience is welcome but not required
Passionate about defense and the mission
Comfortable with the pace and impact of a fast-growing startup
Our Working Style – Why We Might Work Well Together
You care about government & are mission-oriented - Our work is important, and is critical to improving a system that impacts us all.
Perseverance and endurance - Hard problems are worth solving, and solving them can take a long time. There is no such thing as exhausting all options, it’s just time to look for new ones.
Empowerment > micro-management – We’re building a culture of high-performers. Our job is to equip them with what they need and eliminate roadblocks for them to succeed. We trust their judgment, skills, and experience from there.
We’re collaborative and communicate well - Constructive dialogue that takes all viewpoints into account is the only way we get to the right decision. Respect, trust, and complete transparency with each other is critical - keep it all in the open
You’re really good at what you do… but it speaks for itself – High output, no ego. Being humble is extremely important to us
You don’t mind change and are comfortable with uncertainty - We’re deliberate about setting goals, but we’re comfortable changing course and dealing with discomfort to get there. We’re still figuring things out, and that demands being flexible and iterative.
Work doesn’t feel like “work” to you – We’re passionate about what we’re going after, and we devote more time to it than a typical 9-5. That often means putting in extra time at night and occasionally on weekends. However, maintaining your own personal balance comes above all else, and you should establish that however you need to - flexible schedule, taking advantage of time off, or anything else you need.
You like to move fast and have a bias towards action - Our roadmap is directional at this stage - speed and a feeling of urgency is key to prove it out. We expect each other to proactively determine what needs to get done and go for it.
Integrity is never negotiable – Transparency, honesty, and respect comes above all else.
Benefits & Structure
We’re a tight-knit team headquartered in Arlington, VA. We work in the office together most days, and believe being in the same place is a competitive advantage.
Flexible schedule - We all have other things going on in our lives. Doctor visits, kids’ activities, dog walks - take care of it whenever you have to. And work from home when you need to.
Competitive compensation + Sizeable equity - We’re building something with massive upside potential, and you’ll have ownership in that. This is ours.
Flexible vacation time - Use what you want, as long as you’re taking care of what needs to get done.
Full health, dental, and vision insurance.
