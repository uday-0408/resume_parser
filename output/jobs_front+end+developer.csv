Senior Front-End Developer,Ajira AI,,"Oak Brook, IL",,Estimated: $93.7K - $136K a year,,"['Node.js', 'Bootstrap', 'SQL', 'Math', 'ECMAScript', 'UI', 'Senior level', 'AI', '4 years', 'TypeScript', 'Debugging']","At Ajira AI, we focus on developing smart products that leverage artificial intelligence algorithms. We build complex cloud based and mobile business applications. However, make no mistake, we solve very significant systems problems along the way. Our products work across our customers’ ecosystems to help people.
We’re very pleased to be expanding our development team. We’re a close-knit group of innovators that have previously launched very successful companies. We are looking to add Senior Developers to our team in Pune.
You have extensive experience with front end frameworks such as Vue2 or Vue3. Some hands-on experience with UI such as Bootstrap 4/5, Material, Tailwinds etc is needed. Experience with grid and charts components is required. NodeJS experience is welcome. Experience with WebAPI development is a plus. You are the kind of developer that other developers seek out to solve their technical difficulties. You keep up to date with what’s happening in the front-end world as well as WebAPIs and know the difference between versions ES5, ES6 through ES12. You know the limitations of TypeScript. You are motivated to learn new tech`nologies.
That’s a high level summary of what we’re looking for but before we dive into the detail, you’ll probably want to know who you are going to be working for and what your work environment will be like:
Who we are:
We are an Insurtech company with a core mission of leveraging ai algorithms and techniques to solve complex business problems. We like to think that solving these business issues for our customers helps make them better at serving their customers. Some of our applications help people who may be injured or have been in an accident. In our opinion that’s a worthwhile pursuit. While our current business vertical is insurance, we see our technology expanding to other business verticals with time.
We love what we do and not the least of which is that we have the opportunity to try out and ‘play’ with the latest advances in tools and technology.
Who you’ll be working with:
We are a collaborative, tight knit group of contributors. While we’re headquartered in the Chicago area in Lisle, our software lab is located in Pune, India. We have decades of experience working with remote team members. We’re looking to expand our Senior Developer positions in Pune, India.
You’ll find our technology managers a joy to work with; people with excellent technical skills, always willing to mentor, roll up their sleeves and get deep into technical issues. Our management possesses rare technical insight coupled with a remarkable business vision. You’ll be working as a key member of our technical team in what will be an amazing opportunity for you.
Your work environment:
We are a group of talented and dedicated individuals and though we are a software company, we have a ‘no insane hours’ rule.
We are not clock watchers. If you need to take off for a couple of hours to visit the doctor or dentist go ahead. We look at what you’re accomplishing not how many hours you spend in the office. We conduct meetings on a daily basis with our Chicago office so some overlapping hours are necessary.
Our work is performed using the latest technology and tools. We’re constantly innovating and improving our delivery capability by building our own components and tools as well as licensing new tech that we’ve tried and works in our environment.
We are an open, collaborative work environment and suggestions are not just welcome, they are appreciated. You’ll find our product roadmap is exciting and full of opportunity. We believe in compensating our core team with higher than prevailing market wage.
Your skills:
You keep up with technology changes and trends.
You are a top notch Developer whose code not only solves complex issues but is written in such a way that the rest of your team is able to understand. This means that you’re not shy about documenting your code and you understand the need for coding standards and why everyone should use them.
You are motivated. You have amazing debugging skills and are quick at identifying and fixing bugs.
You have overall 4 to 5 years of experience developing front-ends for web-based business solutions.
A minimum of two years of experience with Vue2 or Vue3 is a must.
You are skilled at different versions of ECMAScript from ES5 – ES12 and TypeScript.
You understand MVVM thoroughly.
Experience with NodeJS is a plus.
Experience with WebAPIs is a plus.
Experience with UI including Tailwinds, Bootstrap, Material etc is needed.
Any SQL database experience is a plus as is any background in math.
You possess a general understanding of the fundamentals of an ORM such as NHibernate, Dapper etc.
You have developed, implemented and supported complex business applications at work.

Who We Are:

Eras of humanity can often be defined by a dominant transportation mode—horse-drawn chariots, ocean-going vessels, or aircraft. These transformations were led by small, dedicated teams expanding access to the world through technological breakthroughs. At Inversion, we are building the next such breakthrough: highly maneuverable reentry vehicles that can loiter in orbit and return to Earth with precision. Our goal is to redefine global access by making space part of the everyday transportation fabric.

About the Role:

As a Front-End Engineer focused on Autonomy Mission Interfaces, you will design, develop, and maintain user interfaces that allow mission designers, operators, and engineers to interact with our autonomy system. Your work will shape how high-level human intent is captured, visualized, modified, and converted into machine-executable behaviors. These interfaces must bridge complex backend autonomy logic and user-friendly workflows, enabling rapid validation, modification, and dispatch of missions to both simulators and real spacecraft.

This role is central to making autonomy accessible and operable at scale. You'll work closely with mission, simulation, and GNC teams to ensure tight feedback loops between user input, system validation, and mission execution.

What You’ll Do:

Design and develop intuitive, performant, and flexible user interfaces that enable mission planning, validation, and interaction with live autonomy systems.
Visualize autonomy constructs such as mission graphs, behavior trees, state transitions, and safety constraints in a way that is navigable and editable.
Build tools that allow operators to modify mission objects, inspect validation results, and dispatch commands to simulators or spacecraft.
Integrate with backend autonomy services that decompose mission intent, evaluate constraints, and update internal state in real time.
Develop front-end patterns and components that can be reused across multiple autonomy-related workflows.
Work collaboratively with autonomy and backend engineers to ensure seamless data exchange and coherent user experience.
Contribute to design reviews and usability testing to refine features based on operator needs and mission complexity.

Required Qualifications:

3+ years of professional experience in front-end or full-stack development.
Deep expertise in HTML, CSS, and modern front-end frameworks (React preferred).
Experience with data-driven UIs that allow for real-time updates, graph-based visualizations, or structured user input.
Experience integrating with REST, WebSocket, or gRPC APIs.
Comfort working in a Linux-based environment and with Git-based workflows.
Experience designing interfaces for technical users (e.g., engineers, operators, analysts).
Strong communication skills and an ability to collaborate across teams with different technical backgrounds.
Ability to manage complexity and keep user workflows streamlined and robust.

Desired Qualifications:

Experience with component libraries and design systems (Tailwind CSS, Shadcn UI, Radix UI, etc.).
Familiarity with tools for graph visualization, mission planning, or system modeling (e.g., Cytoscape, D3.js, custom DAG/behavior tree tools).
Understanding of autonomy systems, robotics, or mission operations workflows.
Experience with state synchronization and visual debugging tools for real-time systems.
Familiarity with containerization tools like Docker and deployment workflows.
Experience working in a safety-critical or operational environment is a plus.

Why Join Us:

Build the primary interface between humans and a globally distributed autonomy system.
Shape how space logistics missions are designed, modified, validated, and dispatched.
Join a multidisciplinary, high-velocity team working at the cutting edge of aerospace and autonomy.
Work in an environment that values design clarity, thoughtful engineering, and operator empathy.
Grow alongside world-class engineers while directly contributing to a new mode of global transportation.

1.5% of incentive target for each 1% of attainment between 50% and 75%;
1% of incentive target for each 1% of attainment between 75% and 100%; and once performance exceeds 100% attainment, incentive rates are at or above 1% for each 1% of attainment with no cap on incentive compensation.

Who We Are:

Eras of humanity can often be defined by a dominant transportation mode—horse-drawn chariots, ocean-going vessels, or aircraft. These transformations were led by small, dedicated teams expanding access to the world through technological breakthroughs. At Inversion, we are building the next such breakthrough: highly maneuverable reentry vehicles that can loiter in orbit and return to Earth with precision. Our goal is to redefine global access by making space part of the everyday transportation fabric.

About the Role:

As a Front-End Engineer focused on Autonomy Mission Interfaces, you will design, develop, and maintain user interfaces that allow mission designers, operators, and engineers to interact with our autonomy system. Your work will shape how high-level human intent is captured, visualized, modified, and converted into machine-executable behaviors. These interfaces must bridge complex backend autonomy logic and user-friendly workflows, enabling rapid validation, modification, and dispatch of missions to both simulators and real spacecraft.

This role is central to making autonomy accessible and operable at scale. You'll work closely with mission, simulation, and GNC teams to ensure tight feedback loops between user input, system validation, and mission execution.

What You'll Do:

Design and develop intuitive, performant, and flexible user interfaces that enable mission planning, validation, and interaction with live autonomy systems.
Visualize autonomy constructs such as mission graphs, behavior trees, state transitions, and safety constraints in a way that is navigable and editable.
Build tools that allow operators to modify mission objects, inspect validation results, and dispatch commands to simulators or spacecraft.
Integrate with backend autonomy services that decompose mission intent, evaluate constraints, and update internal state in real time.
Develop front-end patterns and components that can be reused across multiple autonomy-related workflows.
Work collaboratively with autonomy and backend engineers to ensure seamless data exchange and coherent user experience.
Contribute to design reviews and usability testing to refine features based on operator needs and mission complexity.

Required Qualifications:

3+ years of professional experience in front-end or full-stack development.
Deep expertise in HTML, CSS, and modern front-end frameworks (React preferred).
Experience with data-driven UIs that allow for real-time updates, graph-based visualizations, or structured user input.
Experience integrating with REST, WebSocket, or gRPC APIs.
Comfort working in a Linux-based environment and with Git-based workflows.
Experience designing interfaces for technical users (e.g., engineers, operators, analysts).
Strong communication skills and an ability to collaborate across teams with different technical backgrounds.
Ability to manage complexity and keep user workflows streamlined and robust.

Desired Qualifications:

Experience with component libraries and design systems (Tailwind CSS, Shadcn UI, Radix UI, etc.).
Familiarity with tools for graph visualization, mission planning, or system modeling (e.g., Cytoscape, D3.js, custom DAG/behavior tree tools).
Understanding of autonomy systems, robotics, or mission operations workflows.
Experience with state synchronization and visual debugging tools for real-time systems.
Familiarity with containerization tools like Docker and deployment workflows.
Experience working in a safety-critical or operational environment is a plus.

Why Join Us:

Build the primary interface between humans and a globally distributed autonomy system.
Shape how space logistics missions are designed, modified, validated, and dispatched.
Join a multidisciplinary, high-velocity team working at the cutting edge of aerospace and autonomy.
Work in an environment that values design clarity, thoughtful engineering, and operator empathy.
Grow alongside world-class engineers while directly contributing to a new mode of global transportation.

The Leverage team is scaling OpenAI with OpenAI. We apply our latest models to real-world problems in order to assist with or automate work across the company—then share what we learn back to the broader product and research teams. We’ve built an ecosystem of automation products that’s applied everywhere from customer operations to workplace to engineering.

We love building products for folks sitting right next to us, and we take the time to add the little big touches that delight. Our goal is to prototype fast, then build for reliable long-term impact. We're constantly looking for the similarities and patterns in different types of work, and focus on building simple, generic patterns that we can apply across many domains.

About the Role

We’re looking for an engineer who’s passionate about blending product design with new tech and new paradigms. You’ll be at the forefront of creating interfaces that aren’t just functional but delightful, pushing the boundaries of what’s possible with our models. We value engineers who are proactive, product-minded, and who can see the big picture while paying attention to the little details that define great products.

In this role, you will:
Rapidly prototype user experiences that push the envelope of what’s possible with AI.

Iterate quickly, turning ideas into tangible products.

Deliver high-quality, beautiful, joy-inducing interfaces that resonate with users.

Collaborate closely with cross-functional teams, understanding their workflows and uncovering opportunities for transformative improvements.

You might thrive in this role if you:
4+ years of professional engineering experience (excluding internships) in relevant roles at tech and product-driven companies

Are highly skilled in TypeScript, React, and other web technologies, and aren’t afraid to explore corners of the web spec to get stuff done.

Have a strong interest in design — from typographic layout and interaction design to user story-led creation — and are comfortable with tools like Figma.

Have a startup-y background or love bringing products from concept to reality: the 0 → 1 phase.

Interested in applying AI to the real-world (even if you don’t have experience)

Thrive in dynamic environments where ambiguity is the norm and priorities can shift rapidly.

Take ownership of your projects, driving them independently from inception to launch, with a focus on making a real impact.

Frontend Engineer,Pylon,3.3 out of 5 stars,"San Francisco, CA",Full-time,Estimated: $151K - $207K a year,7 days ago,"['Law', 'React', 'Mid-level', 'AWS', 'PostgreSQL', 'GraphQL', 'TypeScript']","At Pylon, we’re a small team building a very ambitious product in the mortgage space.
At this early stage, we’re looking for engineers who can see the opportunity of what we’re building towards and want to shape the user experience of a deeply technical product.
We're in search of frontend engineers who love turning complexity into clarity and who sweat the details in service of usability, performance, and craft. If you thrive on building fast, expressive interfaces and care deeply about the experience behind every click, Pylon could be a great place for you.
About you
You:
Care about the full stack, but specialize in the last mile. You’re most excited about the frontend—but you can reason across the stack and know how to integrate cleanly with backend systems.
Have strong product instincts. You think in flows, not just components. You’re motivated by how users feel, how quickly they understand something, and whether they trust what they see.
Embrace constraints. Designing great UX in a highly regulated, high-stakes domain is a hard problem. You’re energized by solving for clarity in a complex space.
Know your tools and push them hard. Whether it’s squeezing performance out of a rendering path or designing a type-safe form builder, you love building polished, maintainable UI code that scales.
Work autonomously and with impact. You don’t wait around for perfect specs or throw pixels over the wall. You collaborate tightly with engineers, designers, and PMs to build and iterate quickly.
Love strong typing. We use TypeScript across the stack and care a lot about types as a tool for correctness, clarity, and iteration speed. You probably do too.
About the Team
What we’re not:
Building a CRUD app: We’re building a platform that’s only possible due to deep technology investments and thinking hard from first principles. Cargo-culting what’s come before won’t be sufficient. If you’re looking to do mostly plumbing / lego piece assembling, Pylon may be very frustrating for you
An LLM wrapper: Mortgage is a sprawling mess of problems, and there isn't one tool that solves every one of them. We use LLMs, but we've reached for tools in multiple disciplines like mixed-integer linear optimization and programming language research.
An easy job: We’re building a lot of things from the ground up for the first time. Working at Pylon is like a research project where you have to ship to intelligent, opinionated customers regularly. It’s basically guaranteed you’ll be handed a task that is too difficult for you to do. You might fail sometimes. You might have no idea where to start. Our team leans heavily on each other, but there’s no getting around the difficulties.
What we are:
A small team: We don’t have an army of engineers. If you find something is broken, you are probably the best one to fix it. All the code we write has to punch above its weight in maintainability and toil reduction. If you have a good idea, you have much more ability to put it into action than at a large company.
We need generalists: Specialization is for big companies that already have everything figured out. If you’re smart, flexible and like getting into everything, we want you.
Working in a regulated space: Mortgage is regulated both federally and at the state level. We move fast, but breaking things isn’t an option.
About the Job
Basics
Job title: Frontend Engineer
Stock options: Own a piece of the company and we all win together
Benefits: Health insurance, 401K, dental, etc.
Our technology stack:
We don’t require that you’ve worked with any of these technologies before—this is just our stack for your reference:
TypeScript (frontend and backend)
Web Components & React
GraphQL
Nx build system
PostgreSQL
Sagittarius
AWS stack using CDK for declarative infrastructure
NestJS on the backend
On the frontend, you’ll:
Build and own core workflows that define how users interact with Pylon
Collaborate closely with design and backend to ship high-impact features
Bring structure, clarity, and polish to complex forms and workflows
Write clean, well-typed code that balances speed and maintainability
Help evolve our frontend architecture as the product grows
Push for consistency and usability across the interface
General philosophy: Monolith until it hurts. If we can do something without introducing a new service, we will.
About Pylon
The $13 trillion mortgage industry at the core of the American economy runs on broken assembly lines with human-powered workflows, stitched-together software, and a series of capital markets intermediates. The costs to originate are at an all time high despite foundational shifts in technology.
Pylon is rewiring mortgages from the ground up. We are building the only API-first, programmatic infrastructure that fully automates credit, compliance, capital, and operations. For the first time, originators can build and scale mortgage businesses entirely through software, not people. Our team comes from Stripe, Better, and Affirm, and we are backed by Conversion Capital, QED, Citi, Fifth Wall, Peter Thiel, and the founders of Ramp, Mercury, Blend, and others.",,https://www.simplyhired.com/job/1YrhMHSs_DvfzMF69HfTa7RAPUWKhtnUbVCogX_hN1uAjwgjITCUVA
