Exempt new hires participate in Cisco’s flexible Vacation Time Off policy, which does not place a defined limit on how much vacation time eligible employees may use but is subject to availability and some business limitations. All new hires are eligible for Sick Time Off subject to Cisco’s Sick Time Off Policy and will have eighty (80) hours of sick time off provided on their hire date and on January 1st of each year thereafter. Up to 80 hours of unused sick time will be carried forward from one calendar year to the next such that the maximum number of sick time hours an employee may have available is 160 hours. Employees in Illinois have a unique time off program designed specifically with local requirements in mind. All employees also have access to paid time away to deal with critical or emergency issues. We offer additional paid time to volunteer and give back to the community.

Employees on sales plans earn performance-based incentive pay on top of their base salary, which is split between quota and non-quota components. For quota-based incentive pay, Cisco typically pays as follows:
.75% of incentive target for each 1% of revenue attainment up to 50% of quota;
1.5% of incentive target for each 1% of attainment between 50% and 75%;
1% of incentive target for each 1% of attainment between 75% and 100%; and once performance exceeds 100% attainment, incentive rates are at or above 1% for each 1% of attainment with no cap on incentive compensation.
For non-quota-based sales performance elements such as strategic sales objectives, Cisco may pay up to 125% of target. Cisco sales plans do not have a minimum threshold of performance for sales incentive compensation to be paid.",https://d2q79iu7y748jz.cloudfront.net/s/_squarelogo/128x128/f60ba85136045405c5297c160022bc2d,https://www.simplyhired.com/job/xRYe-3Q6eBsS85vsC7rP_UOW2pgQXx4-QaZpnGhxx6ciR4gJHsIhng

"Software Support Engineer, Cell Software",Tesla,3.3 out of 5 stars,"Austin, TX",Full-time,Estimated: $91.4K - $199K a year,15 hours ago,"['Jira', 'Computer science', 'Go', 'Computer Science', 'Software troubleshooting', 'Engineering', 'Git', 'SQL', 'SRE', 'Distributed systems', 'Splunk', 'Rally (agile software)', 'Organizational skills', 'APIs', '1 year', 'Manufacturing', 'Senior level', 'Python']","What to Expect
Tesla is re-thinking how batteries are made from the ground up. We’re designing new factories, new equipment, new processes, and new software to rapidly scale battery manufacturing, globally. The primary bottleneck to Tesla’s future expansion (and the transition to sustainable transport and energy storage) is our ability to produce and procure batteries – that’s why we’re innovating in-house, with our collection of world-class engineers, to redefine the industry. Software, data and automation all play a huge part in this strategy.
We’ve built software from scratch with a nimble and high performing team to meet the specific needs of Tesla’s rapid battery manufacturing scale up. This software tracks every component of the cell manufacturing process and acts as the brain of the entire cell factory.
In tandem we’re building a world-class support engineering team that lives in the cell organization and directly supports the cell software stack. You will join an expert team tasked with maintaining the health of our software systems. We’re looking for someone aiming at becoming an SRE or Dev-Ops Engineer in the future that wants to get their hands dirty with a production software system supporting 100s of machines, 1000s of users, and millions of physical products being made. We need someone that understands monitoring and troubleshooting software platforms – to detect potential issues and respond swiftly if the system becomes unhealthy.
The ideal candidate thrives in a fast-paced environment and can handle multiple issues and escalations at once, triaging and prioritizing them according to an understanding of the cell process and business operations. This is not your standard software support role. You will be embedded with the Dev Team and actively pushing that team to improve the software product. The improvements you push for will have a direct impact on the efficiency of our cell factories. Our team runs 24x7 to match the manufacturing facilities that we support, and you will be needed on an on-call rotation with potential for rotating schedule.
What You'll Do
Be the source of truth, by diving deep into the software, systems, and processes that make Tesla a world leader in Cell Manufacturing
Guide senior developers in what they build and fix next
Be the representative of both the customer and the software and gain valuable insight into how Tesla’s world class developers design and build systems
Diagnose and troubleshoot complex distributed systems handling large volumes of data and develop solutions that have a significant impact at scale
Lead problem resolution and coordination activities; troubleshoot issues across the entire stack - hardware, software, application and network
Drive the program. Own problem prioritization by working with teams at every level and resolving critical issues firsthand. Considered to be the Subject Matter Expert on impact to the manufacturing process
Grow past issues. Utilize automation and monitoring systems to solve problems, not manage them eternally
Be the eye of the storm. When there is an issue, be the calm center to which others rally. Work as incident commander of production critical calls. Coordinate and work with multiple teams to smoothly solve some of the highest risk issues in the factory
Work with high integrity, follows procedures and policies with the handling of sensitive data

What You'll Bring
Degree in Computer Science, or related Engineering degree, or equivalent experience
Experience with traditional enterprise data-center technologies, including compute, storage appliances, virtual machines, and networking
Energized by hunting root causes in a relentless drive towards resolving critical issues. Undaunted in pursuing problems across multiple layers (storage, OS, network, virtualization, and application / DB stack)
Understand how programming languages can be used to create and improve support tools, with an emphasis on how Python and Go interact with databases and APIs. Interested in looking through code to understand what it does
1+ year of working knowledge of SQL, Splunk, or other data analysis/query platform
Understand how tools like Git, Splunk, and Jira can be used to make solving problems easier
Must be able to understand integrated systems and their dependencies
Strong organizational skills along with demonstrated ability to manage multiple tasks simultaneously
Excellent interpersonal skills, energetic and a self-starter; demonstrated ability to meet deadlines and commitments
Position will require being available to perform occasional maintenance and be available for on-call rotation during non-business hours and over the weekends

Who you are:

A startup person: You aren't driven by titles or hierarchy, and prefer efficiency to excess process. You don't need or expect to have a lot of guidance but you enjoy working in a fast-paced team. If you prefer the culture and feel of a large organization, that is great, but you likely won’t enjoy working with us! There is plenty of important work and plenty of good opportunities with organizations like that.

Motivated: You are self-motivated. You bring an enthusiasm to the team, and imbue a sense of passion that goes beyond clocking in and clocking out. This isn’t about a fake or arbitrary “pieces of flair” mentality or lack of work-life balance! It is about being a part of the vision and feeling a part of reaching team goals.

A team-player: Oklo genuinely is a team. We aren’t about taking credit for ourselves, and we aren’t about pushing blame to others. We do incredible things because we work as a team.

An excellent communicator: We need a person who is not only technically competent but also a clear and upbeat communicator.

Creative: Being creative means that when things fall outside clear scopes or processes or problems arise without clear solutions, you are able to identify it as well as invent ways to solve a problem or fill a need without micromanagement. The successful person in this job will not only be creative, but also enjoy being creative and solving open-ended problems which may change day-by-day.

Detail-oriented: This focus is a big part of excellence, consistency, and quality. Even excellent grammar and spelling matter for both good communication as well as the image of the company that we put forward.
